				The ISE Game of Life tool is a project design to simulate the 
				interactions of a number of Agents in a Hunter-Gather like society. The
				society is allowed to form groups, in which leadership characteristics
				and complex politics may emerge. The project comes with a series of 
				pre-implemented agents and simulations Here, we shall briefly explain how to 
				utilise the framework to your own ends.
			</p>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>
				
			</p>

			<h2>Creating your own Simulations</h2>
			<p>
				
			</p>

			<h2>Implementing Your Own Agents</h2>
			<p>
				The {@link AbstractAgent} class defines how an agent (ie, a Hunters) 
				interact with the modelling system. As a result, all custom Agents 
				should extend AbstractAgent. Each agent has a UUID that identifies it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The constructor requires two primary properties - the starting food 
				amount and the amount to consume each round in order to stay alive. 
				Note that the default constructor should not be used. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The remainder of the class contains functions which allow an angent to 
				perform various actions. These include:
				<ul>
					<li>Choosing what to hunt</li>
					<li>Asking others for advice about what to hunt</li>
					<li>Giving advice</li>
					<li>Choosing which group to join and applying to groups</li>
					<li>Making proposals and voting for group movement</li>
					<li>Updating loyalty/happiness/trust values</li>
					<li>Functions to put inputs in a queue and execute them</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The AbstractGroupAgent class defines the behaviour of groups, and are 
				themsleves modelled as agents (to make Presage happy). Each group has 
				a UUID that idetifies it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Groups contain a list of all the members of the group, and respond to 
				applications. In addition, they have fuctions which deal with the 
				creation of new groups (onActivate()) and remove the group once it 
				is empty or disbanded (onDeActivation()).
